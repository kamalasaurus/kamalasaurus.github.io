The what?

> analemma (n.) - <br>1. a scale shaped like the figure 8, showing the declination of the sun and the equation of time for each day of the year.<br>- [dictionary.com][dictionary]

Oh, so helpful!  (troll)

Okay, maybe not that helpful––the analemma can be used to describe the path any celstial body traces through the year at the same time each day, not just the sun.  And it isn't always a figure 8 depending on your latitude, the time of day at which you choose to measure, and which body you're tracking.
