It's interesting how completely the web aesthetic has cycled.  Everyone who remembers AngelFire and GeoCities probably remembers... a world of regret.  Animated GIFs and streaming MIDI!  Sores upon the ears and eyes!  A black hole of information transmission!  A curse upon the beholder!  Now, in our post celery-waved, chip-tuned, and tumblrd world––lo-fidelity computer graphics appear to have resurrected our most primitive languages.

Heiroglyphics... in animated form...

...cause now when we make fun of someone, we make them make fun of themselves!  Like some kind of macabre dancing puppet.

Cue [facebook][facebook].  Wasn't their whole spiel stating they were more respectable, ergo less of a glitter bomb, than MySpace?

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Everyone wants a language to call their own, ya know?
