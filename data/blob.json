Barge FBL-585, a respondent here under an ancient admiralty fiction, is owned by Federal Barge Lines, Inc., the other respondent. After the barge was partially loaded by petitioner, Continental Grain Co., with its soybeans at its wharf in Memphis, the barge sank, causing damage both to the barge and to the soybeans. A dispute arose over what caused it to sink. The barge owner, Federal Barge Lines, Inc., brought an action for damages in a Tennessee state court charging that the barge sank because the cargo owner, Continental Grain Co., had been negligent in loading it. The cargo owner later brought this action in the United States District Court in New Orleans against the barge and its owner, in a single complaint, charging that the vessel had sunk because of its defects and unseaworthiness, and claiming damages for injury to the cargo. In the meantime the damage case against the grain company had been removed from the Tennessee state court to the United States District Court at Memphis. While the litigation arising out of this single occurrence was in this posture in the New Orleans and Memphis courts, the barge-owner defendant, at New Orleans, filed a motion and accompanying affidavits under ยง 1404 (a) to transfer \"this action\" to the United States District Court at Memphis alleging that such transfer was \"necessary for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice. . . .\" This followed the language of ยง 1404 (a), which provides:","span_type":"opinion/paragraph","span_id":13,"start_offset":597,"end_offset":2170,"markups":[{"id":"5589a44e10ffff99dcbab2e1","type":"opinion/markup/page-number"}],"number":3},{"text":"\"For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\"","span_type":"opinion/quote","span_id":14,"start_offset":2170,"end_offset":2360,"markups":[]},{"text":"The New Orleans District Court found that the issue in the Memphis case","span_type":"opinion/paragraph","span_id":15,"start_offset":2360,"end_offset":2431,"markups":[],"number":4},{"text":"\"that is, the cause of the casualty, is precisely the issue in the case at bar.

Blaski and Sullivan v. Behimer, 363 U.S. 335, that this language bars transfer of a \"civil action\" properly pending in one District Court to another in which that \"civil action\" could not have been brought because the defendant legally could not have been subjected to suit there at the time when the case was originally filed. Those cases involved transfers in which the plaintiffs filing the suits would have had no right whatever to proceed originally against the defendants on the \"civil actions\" in the District Courts to which transfer was sought without the defendants' consent. But in this case there was admittedly a right on the part of the grain company to subject the owner of the barge, with or without its consent, to a \"civil action\" in Memphis at the time the New Orleans action was brought. Under these circumstances it would plainly violate the express command of ยง 1404 (a), as construed in our two prior cases, to reverse the District Court's judgment ordering this single civil action to be transferred to Memphis, unless transfer is barred by the joinder of the in rem claim against the barge with the claim against the owner itself. The grain company takes this view of the effect of joinder, arguing that since the barge was in New Orleans when this \"civil action\" was brought and the admiralty in rem claim therefore could not have been brought in Memphis at that time, the entire civil action must remain in the inconvenient New Orleans forum. This view is reached by labeling this single civil action as two, one against the barge and its against the owner. It asserts this view despite the fact that the grain company's suit against the barge and its suit against the owner are in the same complaint for the loss of the same cargo in the same sinking of the same barge producing the same damages. The basis of this view that there are two distinct civil actions for ยง 1404 (a) purposes is a long-standing admiralty fiction that a vessel may be assumed to be a person for the purpose of filing a lawsuit and enforcing a judgment.1","span_type":"opinion/paragraph","span_id":18,"start_offset":3249,"end_offset":5639,"markups":[{"id":"5589a44e10ffff99dcbab315","type":"opinion/markup/page-number"},{"id":"5589a44e10ffff99dcbab332","type":"opinion/markup/page-number"},{"id":"558a792110ffff99dc39b6e3","type":"opinion/markup/citation"},{"id":"55899e6e10ffff99dc9bfa4e","type":"opinion/markup/footnote-reference"}],"number":6},{"text":"The fiction relied upon has not been without its critics even in the field it was designed to serve.

A purpose of the fiction, among others, has been to allow actions against ships where a person owning the ship could not be reached, and it can be very useful for this purpose still. We are asked here, however, to transplant this ancient salt-water admiralty fiction into the dry-land context of forum non conveniens, where its usefulness and possibilities for good are questionable at best.

Moreover, such a situation is conducive to a race of diligence among litigants for a trial in the District Court each prefers.

That situation exists here. Although the action in New Orleans was technically brought against the barge itself as well as its owner, the obvious fact is that, whatever other advantages may result, this is an alternative way of bringing the owner into court. And although any judgment for the cargo owner will be technically enforceable against the barge as an entity as well as its owner, the practical economic fact of the matter is that the money paid in satisfaction of it will have to come out of the barge owner's pocketโincluding the possibility of a levy upon the barge even had the cargo owner not prayed for \"personified\" in rem relief. The crucial issues about fault and damages suffered were identical, whether considered as a claim against the ship or its owner. The witnesses were identical.
