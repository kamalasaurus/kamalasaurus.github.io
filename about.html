<div class="about">

  <p>
    Hopefully, this website will become a home to my intermittent and potentially interesting experimentsâ€“as opposed to another internet abandonment :)

    Regarding the title, I was hoping to convey:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    [...] distress in the mind at something [...] left undone.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Time is ever fleeting!
